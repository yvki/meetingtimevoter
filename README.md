# Project Background
One of my modules for **Year 2** is **Application Devlopment Studio (aka ADES)** where I had to **develop a full stack web app and mobile prototype from scratch over 4 months** based on a given problem statement...

## Basic Problem
Given the **start time** of a **meeting** and the **availability** of all **participants**, pick a **timeslot** that can **accommodate as many participants as possible**.

## Basic Features

1. **Data** Viewer 
- Filter data by ```Meeting Id``` and ```Participant Id```
- Display all attributes from database

2. **Result** Viewer 
- Computation using `Meeting Id` and `Start Time`
- Display `Start Time`, `End Time` and `Participant Id` of all participants attending the meeting

## Advance Problem
Given the **start time** and **end time** of a **meeting** and the **unavailability** of all **participants**, pick a **timeslot** that **fulfills the duration** and can **accommodate as many participants as possible**.

## Advance Features

1. **Data** Viewer 
- Filter data by ```Meeting Id``` and ```Participant Id```
- Display all attributes from database

2. **Result** Viewer 
- Computation using `Meeting Id`, `Start Time` and `End Time`
- Display `Start Time`, `End Time` and `Participant Id` of all participants attending the meeting
